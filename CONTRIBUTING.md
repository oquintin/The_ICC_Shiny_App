Contributing to the ICC Shiny App

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ICC Shiny App. Contributions are welcome from researchers, statisticians, educators, and developers who wish to improve the tool, extend its functionality, or support the ICC database.

This document outlines how you can contribute.

Ways to Contribute

You do not need to be a software developer to contribute. Useful contributions include:

Reporting bugs or unexpected behaviour

Suggesting improvements to the interface or functionality

Proposing additional ICC estimation methods from the literature

Improving documentation or tutorials

Using the app in teaching and providing feedback

Contributing ICC estimates to the database

Submitting code improvements or new features

Reporting Issues

If you encounter a problem or have a suggestion:

Go to the Issues tab of the GitHub repository

Check whether a similar issue already exists

If not, open a new issue and provide:

A clear description of the problem or suggestion

Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)

Screenshots if helpful

Suggesting Methodological Extensions

If you would like to see an additional ICC estimation method or uncertainty approach implemented:

Open an issue describing the method

Provide references to the relevant methodological literature

Explain briefly how it could fit within the app

Methodological correctness and published support are essential for inclusion.

Contributing Code

Developers wishing to contribute code can:

Fork the repository

Create a new branch for the feature or fix

Submit a pull request describing:

What has been added or changed

Why it is useful

Any dependencies introduced

All pull requests are reviewed by the maintainer before merging.

Contributing to the ICC Database

ICC estimates can be contributed directly through the form embedded in the app. The database is hosted on REDCap by the Pragmatic Clinical Trials Unit at Queen Mary University of London.

When submitting an ICC, please ensure you provide:

The ICC value

Description of the trial population

Type of cluster

Outcome description

A publication link, DOI, or PMID if available

Providing detailed and accurate information increases the usefulness of the database for other users.

Documentation Improvements

Suggestions to improve the README, tutorials, examples, or explanatory text are very welcome. Clear explanations are important as the app is also used for teaching and training.

Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow respectful and professional behaviour. Please see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

Questions or Ideas

If you are unsure whether your idea fits the project, feel free to open an issue to discuss it before starting work.

We greatly appreciate contributions that help make the ICC Shiny App more useful for the CRT research community.
