Description: 
    An R Shiny application supporting the estimation, interpretation, and 
    appropriate use of intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) in the 
    design and analysis of cluster-randomised trials. The app integrates 
    multiple ICC estimation methods across outcome types, supports 
    uncertainty modelling, and provides access to a curated ICC database 
    hosted on REDCap by the Pragmatic Clinical Trials Unit at Queen Mary 
    University of London.
